    <h1>Fear of success</h1>

    <p>Believe it or not, most people fear success as much as they fear failure. As such, most people are afraid of becoming millionaires.
 
        Chrometophobia (intense fear of money) is a common condition for most people. Nobody knows exactly why this happens, but it is commonly believed that the condition has something to do with upbringing.
         
        Most people are brought up in an environment of lack of money; therefore, they believe that money is associated with evil. The condition doesn’t go away even when we become adults, because by then our minds are already conditioned.

        This affects our spending habits and our ability to become rich, which makes it difficult to save any money for the future. This happens because we are subconsciously trying to get rid of this ‘perceived’ evil called “money.”

        <h1>Lack of patience</h1>

        

        </p>

        <p id="chapter2">

        <p>Most people simply do not have the patience to become millionaires.

            Consider when you plant a seed in the ground; you probably don’t understand how the seed germinates a few days or weeks later. Neither does it help to check the progress each and every day.
           
           But a few weeks later, when you check it, you’ll find that the buds have shot up and the plant is beginning to grow. A few more weeks, and it becomes a big plant. All this takes some work, time, and a process.
           
           This is where patience comes into play.
           
            Seed is the raw material you put into the soil, and work is the time and  effort you invest. The process is what takes effect without your  interference. It is beyond your control.
           
           Most people would probably want to plant a seed and eat its fruit the following morning.

            <h1>Lack of focus</h1>

            <p>The successful warrior is the average man with laser-like focus — Bruce Lee, a Kung Fu Martial arts legend.

                Perhaps the greatest hindrance to financial success is a lack of focus. Most millionaires I know are highly focused individuals.
                
                Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, co-founder and former executive Chairman of the Alibaba Group, often  says that he gets about 5,000 new business ideas every day. Unfortunately, he is forced to turn them all down, preferring to remain  focused on delivering quality service to the millions of customers and  suppliers who visit his online stores daily.
